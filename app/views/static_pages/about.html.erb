      Welcome to the Marin Cricket Club! Our goal is to play and promote cricket in the Bay Area in a fun, relaxed and inclusive environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a proud member of the <%= link_to 'Northern California Cricket Association', 'http://www.ncalcricket.org', target: 'blank' %>
      and we run a 3 tiered team structure. We run two League teams playing as part of NCCA and a Social team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Socials team plays nearly every weekend primarily on Saturdays from the beginning of May until the end of October.
      Our league teams tour around all parts of the Bay Area but are usually found hosting games on our field on Sundays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our home games are played at Piper Park, located in Larkspur.
      It is a beautiful place to both watch and play a game of cricket and we'd love for you to stop by
      and chat with us to learn more about our club or about how the game is played.
    </p>
